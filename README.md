# Bash utils repository

In this repository I save scripts I need to do tasks I need to do automatically. 

**01CopyBasedOnxspfList.sh** - This script is to copy the files you have in a playlist, with xpsf ending, to a location, for example to a USB drive. I use this because I have some lists and want to have them in an USB to play music while traveling by car.
